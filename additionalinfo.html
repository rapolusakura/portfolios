  <h2>Likes and Dislikes</h2> 
  <p>I love coding and solving problems. I like thinking logically and trying to solve difficult problems by figuring out an algorithim, or solution that works elegantly for different scenarios in a problem. I like engineering and programming because I learn how to to build and construct objects. These are very important and versatile tools that allow me to apply my knowledge into more humanities based work like stopping food waste or writing.

  I dislike traditional schooling because I feel like it is very arbitrary and inefficient. Especially since I am starting my last year of high school, I have the ability to do a lot of different internships and programs and pursue independent work but I am limited because I still have to focus on school and do work for classes that ultimately, will not contribute to my future career. I am excited to be a senior in part because I will have freedom but I am also not looking forward to another year that I will likely have to spend doing meaningless work. </p>
