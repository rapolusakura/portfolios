<h5> Fill in the Shapes: A game modeled after PacXon. 
<p>This was the first large-scale game that I created along with a partner at the Girls Who Code program. It was done through Scratch which in hindsight, was an ineffective and frustrating platform to program on. Most of the difficulty in creating a MVP was with a quirk in Scratch's color detecting program, and lack of ability to floodfill. We generally have a working product with the basic features but lack the more complex functionalities of the original game.</p>
