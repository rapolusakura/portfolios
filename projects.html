<h5> Fill in the Shapes: A game modeled after PacXon. 
<p>This was the first large-scale game that I created along with a partner at the Girls Who Code program. It was done through Scratch which in hindsight, was an ineffective and frustrating platform to program on. Most of the difficulty in creating a MVP was with a quirk in Scratch's color detecting program, and lack of ability to floodfill. We generally have a working product with the basic features but lack the more complex functionalities of the original game.</p> 
<h3>Python</h3>

<h5> Obamicon: A photo filter program. 
<p>This program utilized Python's Photo Imaging Library to access image data and RGB values. This simple filter program analyzes the intensity of individual pixels and recolors them and forms a new image.</p>
